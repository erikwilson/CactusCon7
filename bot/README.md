# CactusCoin

## Hack All The Things

This year's badge is based around a TTGO LoRa OLED ESP32 and contains six capacitive buttons driven from four sensor inputs. It requires a single 18650 lithium ion rechargable battery. Optional circuitry supports a motor driver which operates on the same lines as the OLED.
